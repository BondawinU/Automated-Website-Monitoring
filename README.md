# Automated Website Monitoring
This project provides a simple solution to monitor the availability of websites by checking their HTTP status codes. The script reads a list of website URLs from an Excel file, sends a request to each site, and logs the status code in the Excel file. If a website is unreachable, it logs a custom message instead.
